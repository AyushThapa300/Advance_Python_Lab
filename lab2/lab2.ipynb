    "Q. Is for loop an iterator?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: No, a for loop is not an iterator. A for loop is a looping (control) statement, not an object. It does not store data or implement iterator methods like iter() and next(). Instead, it works with an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) by internally creating an iterator from that iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "During execution, the for loop repeatedly calls the iterator’s next() method to fetch elements one by one. When there are no more elements, the iterator raises a StopIteration exception, and the loop automatically stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. Differences between iterator and generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: i. An iterator is an object that allows traversal through elements of a collection by implementing the iter() and next() methods, and it may require more code to create. A generator is a special type of iterator created using a function with the yield keyword, which automatically handles iteration and state management.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii.Generators are more memory-efficient because they produce values lazily, one at a time, instead of storing all values in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "DISCUSSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, the concepts of iterators, generators, and decorators in Python were studied and analyzed. The working of iterators was observed through the use of the iter() and next() methods, while generators were examined using the yield keyword to produce values lazily. The role of decorators in modifying the behavior of functions without altering their source code was also explored using the @decorator syntax. Comparisons were made in terms of code simplicity, memory efficiency, and functionality. It was observed that generators reduced memory usage and coding effort, whereas decorators improved code reusability and readability. Overall, a better understanding of advanced Python features was achieved through this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCLUSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore,we were able to learn about iterators,generators and decorators as well as implement them in python."
